This is a little openFrameworks application I made to play with NeuroSky's headset.

The aim of the application was to create abstract art using human neuronal activity.

I did not finished the application (which doesn't do a lot of art right now) but it's code might inspire other coders.

NOTE: The application contains an interesting FlowerBrush which can reproduce flowers seen in Flowerium http://makotohirahara.com/portfolio/Flowerium/

Fill free to clone and play with the code!
